# React Jeopardy

Jeopardy is an American game show created by [Merv Griffin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merv_Griffin). The show is a quiz competition that reverses the traditional question-and-answer format of many quiz shows. Rather than being given questions, contestants are instead given general knowledge clues in the form of answers and they must identify the person, place, thing, or idea that the clue describes, phrasing each response in the form of a question. Jeopardy Game that allows you to fully interact with the UI and have some fun.

Here's the original layout from the game board since November 26, 2001:

This project was created during a live stream of an #100Devs Community Stream Event on twitch by @mayanwolfe
We learned how to use Vite + React as a building tool to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.

### Built With
In React Jeopardy we used various tools to create this app such as:

* [![Vite][Vite.js]][Vite-url]
* [![React][React.js]][React-url]
